      <h2>Knicks In  Six</h2>
      <p>So if I look at these teams like I look at girlfriends, Me and Jets had the best moments. Thats always gonna be the case. The Mets were the girl around the way. We spent so much time together and at the end of the day, we always gon be friends before anything.. Like girl, my momma loved you! But the Knicks though, thats the first love. inseparable. 2nd grade. Diana Martinez.. Wassup girl! :: Birdman hands :: I mean, everyone else had jordans.. i had the pat ewings with the purple plastic ball and would bring out my inner charles oakley to anyone who dare to try and say somethin</p>
                        <p>Before my sister read this and clown me, I willingly admit I got bullied by a girl I affectionately named "Big Bull Martha"</p>
                        <p>Ayy, we made it. 3 statements in and I finally mentioned the Knicks. Sorry yall, the coffee done kicked in. Bear with me </p>
                        <p>Our RocNation Brunch Baby, The Point Gawd, Quick, is in the kitchen with Brick.. Say less!</p>
                        <p>Obi, Rj, Cam, and Grimes back working already.. love to see it</p>
                        <p>if Thibs weren't our coach, id be flaming my guy daily. But he's our creepy looking, overly obsessed, old-school coach tryna learn new tricks and I love him!</p>
                        <p>Mark Jackson in 2023/24 once the dust settles on the roster though...</p>
                        <p>Mitch,just do the dam Mikan drills and worked on a bank shot. Love to see the work but I want my guy to think Tim Duncan not Kevin Durant. Both were unstoppable</p>
                        <p>I want Mitch here. 4 yrs, 60 mil. Get it done. Are we seriously not gonna give our own draft pick patrick Beverly money??</p>
                        <p>Julius on the other hand.. Think he did some really lame shit. Basketball wise think he could be a great contributor. Just seemed like he couldnt handle not being the guy, which he aint.. sorry buddy. someone gotta say it. so maybe we try and find another fit, but even making something work on the trade machine was hard. good luck to the front office figuring that out</p>
                        <p>RJ BARRETT!! RJ BARRETT!! .. I can get used to the sounds of that</p>
                        <p>When Deuce averages 30,8, & 7 in the G league this year.. what do we do?</p>
                        <p>Who else is excited for Rokas Summer League Minutes??</p>
                        <p>Sims activity on defense was outstanding at the end of the season. some tape and attention to detail will do him wonders. Love Thibs for his development. Noel Gotta GO!!</p>
                        <p>Obi, Quick, Grimes, Sims, Deuce, Rokas. IF we draft based on what we got in house and trying to develop, it has to be a wing in the draft right??</p>
                        <p>while im still focused, ima move on to the Jets baby.</p>
                        <p>Sorry just gonna sit here and bask in the fact I made it thru that post with minimal interruptions minus that part at the beginning where I came in completely off the rails..</p>
